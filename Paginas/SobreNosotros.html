				<h1>About us</h1>
				<h2>Origins</h2>
				<div class="text">
					Back in the late 2010s, a small group of web developers with love for the retro computer world and the preserving of the golden age, an age of games in cassette, floppy disks and pixel graphics, got themselves onto the fray and after several weeks of work, Retro World came to life.
				</div>
				<h2>Our goal</h2>
				<div class="text">
					As you may have guessed, the goal of this page is to preserve and maintain data about the classic home computers that gave us many afternoons, waiting for the tape to load and playin what many may call "horrendous" games with very little graphics. On this website you can find a lot of info, from generic data to emulation sites, documentals, events and even a shop that can ship to almost every part of the world and give you the products that you can't find on those actual game stores.
				</div>
				<h2>At the current time</h2>
				<div class="text">
					This web is still very early in the development phase, so many of the features can't be reached. Only a few systems and games have pages, and there are no emulation sites linked or documentals loaded. The shop is non existent, so your retro computer itch will have to wait. Keep in mind we are people with works, life and family, so our time to do this is very limited.
