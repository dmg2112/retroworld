			<h3 class="grid_titulo">Goody</h3>
			<p class="grid_texto">In Goody you are a thief with a mission to break into a Spanish bank. In order to accomplish that you need the appropriate tools, such as a torch and pincers. On the way toward the bank you must avoid policemen, gorillas, kung-fu experts, women sweeping the street, paper airplanes, and other hazards. The game is a platformer with light puzzle-solving which requires usage of the correct object in the correct place, similar to Jet Set Willy.</p>

			<h3 class="grid_titulo">Batman</h3>
			<p class="grid_texto">Based on the 1989-Batman movie. The game consists of five different parts, each resembling well known game types. Part one, the chemical plant: Hunt down Jack Napier who has raided the plant (typical platform action, climb ladders or use "Bat"-rope and shoot at some enemies...). Part two, "Batmobile" (...the car): Joker is chasing you and have to escape to "Bat"-cave. Avoid obstacles like police blocking the road and others. Part three, "Bat"-cave: A puzzle game where you have to find a certain item (belonging to Joker) amongst other items. Part four, "Batjet": Cut the ropes of the balloons which are filled with poisonous gas. Part five, the cathedral: Hunt down Joker. This part plays like the first one. Finally you will confront Joker </p>

			<h3 class="grid_titulo">Future Wars</h3>
			<p class="grid_texto">In the year 1989, a simple window cleaner is working outside of a skyscraper. Intending to play a prank on his angry boss, the unlikely hero discovers a secret passage leading to a time machine along with mysterious alien documents. Operating the device transports the protagonist to the year 1304, where he is given a seemingly ordinary task of rescuing a lady in danger. However, he soon finds out about a much more serious threat of a global alien invasion. The hero has to travel to the remote future of the 44th century and eventually to the even more remote past of the Cretaceous period to foil their plans. Future Wars is a graphic adventure game, and the first to use Delphine's proprietary Cinematique point-and-click interface. A right click brings up the verb menu. After choosing one of the six commands, the player points the mouse over the desired target and executes the action with a left click. Small objects are depicted by enlarged drawings once they have been discovered; however, many of them are well-hidden and often require precise positioning on the part of the player character to discover. The game has a linear story advancement, and it is possible to die or become irrevocably stuck by failing to locate a crucial item in one of the previous locations.</p>

			<h3 class="grid_titulo">Mario and Luigi</h3>
			<p class="grid_texto">Mario and Luigi, the best plumbers in the world, have a real job on their hands. A host of characters have taken over the sewers, and the brothers must clear them out of the pipes.
				The platform puzzle which first introduced Luigi to the world has both single and multiplayer action with two differing game types, but with the same objective. Crabs, turtles and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping underneath the platform they sit on, then kicking them away. Each level is cleared when a set number of coins is collected.
				For the two player mode, the first to collect the set amount of coins wins.</p>

			<h3 class="grid_titulo">Death Bringer</h3>
			<p class="grid_texto">Death Bringer a.k.a Galdregon’s Domain is a fun dungeon-crawl epic that makes up for its lackluster plot with good gameplay and a vast gameworld to explore. The premise is as cliché as it gets in this kind of game: the dead evil wizard Azazael has risen again as a powerful Lich, retrieved the five gems of Zator, and hence enslaving mankind. You are a freebooter barbarian who– naturally– was commissioned by the King to retrieve the five gems and return to the King. Zator’s fate rests upon your shoulders as you venture forth into the unknown lands. The game features a 3D view of the world, which can be explored step by step like in many RPGs of the time, e.g. Bard’s Tale or Dungeon Master. </p>

			<h3 class="grid_titulo">Chaos Engine</h3>
			<p class="grid_texto">At the end of The Chaos Engine you managed to put a stop to Baron Fortesque's out of control machine, only to free the Baron himself from its clutches. Unfortunately not everything went to plan after that. During the confusion the Baron snuck away back into his own contraption and into another time period. Our two heroes decide the only way to stop him is follow him, but unfortunately luck isn't on their side... Both players (either two human or one human and one computer controlled) are trapped within the Chaos Engine and can only escape by helping the Baron rebuild the engine. He will reward the character who helps him the most by granting him freedom, thus pitching our two heroes against each other. Where as The Chaos Engine was a two-player co-operative game, The Chaos Engine 2 is a two-player competitive game! </p>
